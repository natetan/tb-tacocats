## Description
We built an app designed to help people interact with and learn from data on Tuberculosis (TB) collected from the World Health Organization. Tuberculosis is a highly contagious disease that infects the lungs. More information can be found [here](http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.1315?lang=en)

## HIV & TB
HIV and TB are commonly linked together because as an individual's immune system becomes compromised through contraction of HIV, it becomes significantly more likely that one will catch Tuberculosis.

## Multi-drug-resistant TB
A mutated strain has emerged called MDR/RR Tuberculosis. This strain is of particular interest because of the danger it poses, since most of our medicines do not work against it. Global data was not collected by the World Health Organization on this until 2005.

As you navigate this app, you can discover for yourself the ways TB, HIV, and Drug Resistant TB are impacting this world both separately and together.

## Implementation
We implemented this app using R as our backend in RStudio. We used a variety of R libraries to help us with the visuals, such as `ggplot2` and `plotly`. We implemented the frontend using a web application framework for R known as `Shiny`.
